# Voice Activity Detection
This is a project in AI2615 in SJTU implemented by Qingquan Bao.
The code is still be continued.

## Temporal feature + naive classifier
In `naiveVAD.py` and `state_machine.py`, we implement Logisitic Resgression and State Machine classifier to detect voice activity in develop dataset.

To predict labels in new data, run `python vad4test.py`

## Spectral feature + GMM
To be implemented...
